❑ Analytic Requirements:
1. Need to know what is selling in the stores each day to evaluate product movement, as well as to see how sales are impacted by promotions
2. Need to understand the mix of products in a customer’s market basket
3. Changes to Point of Sales Device on each channel are recorded to know the frequency of channel POS device replacement

9. Purchasing Manager needs to know the efficient vendors based on differential days between order date and delivery date
10. Sales Manager needs to know what are the most demanding products for each time period of the day

❑ Deliverables:
▪ Designed an Enterprise Data ware house that addresses the analytic requirements
▪ Built Data Mart Cubes for functional areas based on the analytic requirements using SQL Server Analysis services (Using both Multidimensional and Tabular Models)
▪ Used Tableau and Power BI to design Data Visualisations for business users and management to enable informed decisions
